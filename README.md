### Hi there 👋

I’m Davide and after several years spent working on the development of companies in the E-Commerce sector, I decided to look behind the scenes and deepen my technical knowledge and start on the path to becoming a web developer 👨🏻‍💻

During my recent intensive course at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time) I learned why I truly love to code 💜

Over this period, after implementing various projects and being impressed by the simplicity but at the same time the power of the Ruby on Rails framework, I realised the immense satisfaction I get from building something real, that could make someone's life easier, using nothing but code and my own effort.

I'm currently looking to contribute to a team where I can prove my skills while growing in my capabilities 🚀
